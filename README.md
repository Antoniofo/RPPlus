## Inforamtion

The hacking system has changed. When you hack, every second will count in the final take. 
The hack can have a duration defined by the server admin inside the plugin's config. If you go to far from the hack location, the hack will stop but you will still gain money.
It will take a random number between the minMoney and maxMoney (can be chnaged) a will multiplie by the number of second you were hacking.
So for example if the hack is 60 second long and you take 30 beacause you went too far and the minMoney is 500 and maxMoney is 800, your gain will be 30*558 = 16'740â‚¬ if the random number is 558.
Note that when a hack is starting like the original plugin all LawEnforcement Biz will be alerted.
